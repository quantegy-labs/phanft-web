				<h1>NFTs for Noobs</h1>
				<p>Just relax you&apos;re doing fine</p>
				<p>
					We appreciate that NFTs, blockchain, and cryptocurrency are all new territories – each
					with their own steep learning curve and risks to be aware of. We also know that for many
					of you, this will be your first time learning about and/or investing in an NFT project.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this new and fast evolving space we are all n00bs and it’s best to approach it all with
					an open, learner’s mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ve put together this Helping Phriendly Guide (FAQ) to help you navigate the important
					things to understand.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please jump to the glossary section at the bottom for simple explanations of the key terms
					and concepts here.

				<div>What is Discord?</div>
				<div>
					Discord hosts our PhanFT community hub. It's a place to get real time updates on the
					project, hang out, engage with the community, discuss a variety of interests, and plants
					seeds for serendipity. It has become the gold standard community platform for NFT
					projects, and by the end of 2022 we expect every brand will have one.{' '}

				<div>What is an NFT?</div>
				<div>
					NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token” and it is a unique, one-of-a-kind digital item that
					users can buy, own, and trade on the blockchain. NFTs are bought and sold using
					cryptocurrencies (most commonly Ethererum).
				</div>
				<div>Where on the Blockchain do NFTs live?</div>
				<div>
					Currently, most NFTs on the market live on the Ethereum blockchain. But there are other
					blockchains as well supporting NFTs including Solana, Polygon, and others.
				</div>
				<div>Okay, but what can an NFT be?</div>
				<div>
					An NFT can represent almost anything such as: Digital Collectibles Artwork Concert Tickets
					Video Games Music &amp; Publishing Contracts to real-world assets such as Real Estate
					Digital ID and Avatar Club Membership Cards And many more…
				</div>
				<div>How is ownership of the NFT guaranteed?</div>
				<div>
					Ownership is written into the smart contract that lives on the blockchain forever and
					governs the rights of that digital asset. This is what allows digital items such as images
					(which as we know them historically are easily cloneable) to now be bought, sold, or
					traded with both trust and transparency.
				</div>
				<div>What are the essential characteristics and benefits of NFTs?</div>
				<div>
					Unique – An NFT&rsquo;s metadata describes what makes this asset different from all the
					rest in a collection. This is a permanent, unalterable record that describes what this NFT
					represents, like the certificate of authenticity that you&rsquo;d get with a rare
					painting. Rare – Scarcity is an important ingredient in the recipe that makes NFTs so
					attractive. While developers have the freedom to generate an infinite supply of certain
					assets, they also have the power to limit the number of rare, desirable items in
					existence. This preserves value. It&rsquo;s the same reason a physical show print is made
					in limited allotments. Sure, the artist could print 20,000 for the whole venue but they
					wouldn&rsquo;t sell them all, and they wouldn&rsquo;t hold long-term value. Supply and
					demand economics holds true with NFTs too. Ownership – Blockchain technology proves your
					ownership while making the change of ownership rights easy. Just like you own a physical
					piece of art (like a show poster), you own this digital art. You can choose to keep it,
					sell it, trade it, commercialize it, or exploit it in other ways as you see fit, depending
					on the rights assigned to you in the smart contract. Transferability – NFTs can be freely
					traded, transferred, or sold. Security &amp; Authenticity – The smart contract behind the
					NFT prevents fraud prevention, a problem affecting everything from art to concert tickets,
					collectibles, fashion, even wine. Blockchain powered NFTs are the perfect weapon against
					counterfeiting while giving buyers confidence that they&rsquo;ll get what they paid for.
				</div>
				<div>
					Why can’t I just right-click and save these digital items or take a screenshot of it?
				</div>
				<div>
					Sure, you could take a screenshot but you don&rsquo;t own it. You can&rsquo;t sell it,
					trade it, or prove you own it on the blockchain. You can&rsquo;t redeem it for perks and
					accessibilities that owning the real one would grant you. For ex: I can take a picture of
					a $100 bill but it doesn&rsquo;t mean I actually have that money, and no merchant would
					accept my picture of that bill. I can take a picture of a gym membership card, but if I
					tried to use it, it wouldn&rsquo;t grant me access to the gym.
				</div>
				<div>How do I mint an NFT?</div>
				<div>
					Here&rsquo;s the general process to buying an NFT from an on-sale (aka minting). Step 1:
					you need to buy some Ethererum. It can be purchased easily on Coinbase using dollars or
					most other global currencies. If you&rsquo;re new to buying Ethereum (or any other
					cryptocurrency) we recommend using Coinbase. Step 2: to transfer the Ethereum you bought
					(or already owned), to a wallet that can purchase the NFT. We recommend Metamask. You can
					download and install as a Chrome Browser Extension, and as a mobile app for iOS and
					Android. Here&rsquo;s an instructional{' '}
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
						<strong>
							<em>YouTube video</em>
						</strong>
					</a>{' '}
					showing how. Step 3: Transfer the necessary amount of Ethereum (ETH) + .05 to .10 extra
					ETH for gas fees (i.e. transactions fees) to your Metamask wallet. Step 4: Authenticate
					your wallet on the website where you&rsquo;ll be buying the NFT by pressing the “Connect
					Wallet” button. Step 5: When the mint is live, press the “Mint” or “Buy” button on the
					website, and enter the number of NFTs you want to buy. Metamask will pop up and
					you&rsquo;ll be able to see estimated gas fees and approve or reject the transaction. If
					you&rsquo;re okay with the fees click “approve” and you&rsquo;re done! You&rsquo;ll know
					whether the mint was successful and will soon see the NFT appear in your Metamask mobile
					wallet. Note: you can&rsquo;t view your NFTs in the Metamask desktop Chrome extension.
					Note: when we announce the minting date for The Lizards we&rsquo;ll be publishing a
					separate “Rollout” section to the website to walk you through our specifics.
				</div>
				<div>What are gas fees? Do I need gas to buy an NFT?</div>
				<div>
					“Gas” is basically units of energy that&rsquo;s burned during a transaction on the
					Ethereum network, while computers are verifying transactions and adding them to the
					blockchain. Think of it as a transaction fee, and it goes directly to Ethereum miners who
					provide the computer power necessary to verify transactions. Gas prices fluctuate based on
					the demand at any given time. PhanFT does not receive a percentage of gas fees and has no
					control over network congestion or gas prices.
				</div>
				<div>If I mint a lizard, how will I know what traits and attributes its art will have?</div>
				<div>
					Think of it like opening a baseball card pack and pulling one card. You don&rsquo;t know
					which player you get. With our Lizard collection, each Lizard is unique and different in
					traits, with some more rare than others. You have the option of minting up to 5 Lizards
					per wallet address at the on-sale. If you&rsquo;re seeking to acquire a rarer one, or find
					another in the collection whose art you like better, you can always trade with other
					holders or sell them. Likewise, you could equally mint one of the rarest, most unique, and
					cool looking ones of the whole collection. This includes a Rutherford The Brave, of which
					25 are being included in the collection.
				</div>
				<div>What if I want to sell my lizard NFT sometime after I buy it?</div>
				<div>
					You can sell your Lizard(s) anytime. There are several marketplaces where you can buy/sell
					NFTs, the market leader being OpenSea. OpenSea is like eBay for buying and selling NFTs.
					We encourage you to check the site out and spend some time exploring.
				</div>
				<div>How can I make money here?</div>
				<div>
					When the Lizard collection is sold out, there will be a secondary market for buyers and
					sellers. As it stands today, most of this activity will happen on OpenSea.io. Once more
					phans want to own a lizard than ones available, you&rsquo;d be able to sell yours for a
					profit. We recommend buying multiple Lizards so you can sell some if you wish, and keep at
					least one to remain a member of our community and receive all the phan-centric benefits
					and perks we offer Lizard holders. Remember that all sales (including secondary market
					sales) pay a royalty to the artist, which will make them very happy.
				</div>
				<div>How do I help save the race of lizards from extinction?</div>
				<div>
					Buy at least one (1) Lizard during our Mint. It will remove it from their life of
					purgatory in Prussia and bring them safely to the Phanaverse where they can live in peace,
					harmony, and tranquility.
				</div>
				<div>Other questions you’d like us to add to this FAQ?</div>
				<div>
					Please email them to hello(at)phanft.com. We’ll keep this updated and as robust as
					possible so phans with all levels of tech acumen can understand this and choose whether to
					participate.

				<h2>Glossary</h2>
				<p>Listed in order to maximize understanding</p>
				<h3>NFT</h3>
				<p>
					NFT stands for “Non-Fungible Token” and it is a unique, one-of-a-kind digital item that
					users can buy, own, and trade on the blockchain. NFTs are bought and sold using
					cryptocurrencies.
				</p>
				<h3>Non-Fungibile</h3>
				<p>
					A non-fungible asset is something unique and irreplaceable. It can&rsquo;t be swapped for
					the same good in like kind. An autographed book, a rare old coin, or The Great Went
					Pollock Walking Fish, is non-fungible as they both can&rsquo;t be easily replaced. A
					physical art print is non-fungible. An NFT is non-fungible.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<h3>Fungibile</h3>
				<p>
					In simple words, fungibility refers to something replaceable or exchangeable. An asset or
					a good is fungible if you can replace or exchange all or part of it with another
					indistinguishable equivalent. Currencies (imagine a $5 bill), Gold, Wheat, Oil, are all
					fungible goods. A $5 bill is completely exchangeable with any $5 bill – its value is
					exactly the same.
				</p>
				<h3>Crypto Wallets</h3>
				<p>
					Buying, storing, and selling NFTs is quite simple and you do it all through a crypto
					wallet. Think of it like a digital version of the wallet you carry around in your pocket
					or purse. Except only you hold the special keys and the password to open it. And
					it&rsquo;s important you safeguard those keys by keeping them written somewhere safe. They
					are the only way to access or restore your wallet. More on wallets here in this{' '}

				</p>
				<h3>Mint or Minting</h3>
				<p>
					The process by which an NFT becomes part of the blockchain. Once an asset is put on the
					blockchain, it is “minted” as a token and cannot be altered. Just like how physical coins
					are minted and put into circulation, it&rsquo;s the same for NFTs. If you buy a Lizard
					from us directly when they go on-sale, you are Minting a Lizard.
				</p>
				<h3>Ethereum</h3>
				<p>
					The largest blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ethereum is currently the main
					platform for NFT projects. The Ethereum blockchain acts as a decentralized computer in
					addition to being a distributed ledger. It can run blockchain-based applications called
					“Smart Contracts”.
				</p>
				<h3>Ether (or ETH)</h3>
				<p>
					The cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Ether can be purchased using fiat currency
					such as U.S. dollars on a variety exchanges such as Coinbase, or within certain crypto
					Wallets such as Metamask.
				</p>
				<h3>Smart Contacts</h3>
				<p>
					These are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions
					are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all
					participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary&apos;s
					involvement or time loss. In the case of PhanFT, smart contracts are how ownership is
					determined, and how payments to multiple parties including the seller, the artist, and the
					charity partner are automatically made when a transaction takes place.
				</p>
				<h3>Gas</h3>
				<p>
					“Gas” is used to describe a unit of measurement for the amount of computational power
					needed for executing specific operations on the Ethereum network. When buying an NFT on
					the Ethereum network, it&rsquo;s a cost necessary to perform the transaction. The price of
					gas fluctuates based on network congestion at that moment. ETH Gas prices are denominated
					in a unit known as gwei, which is a term used to refer to an amount of ETH equal to
					0.000000001 ETH. The total gas used to mint your NFT will become your transaction fee.
					There&rsquo;s lots of articles and YouTube videos explaining this in more depth.{' '}
					<a href="https://youtu.be/hQ78FVSv-vs" className="inner-link">
						Here&rsquo;s a 3 minute explainer video on YouTube.
					</a>
				</p>
				<h3>NFT Marketplaces</h3>
				<p>
					Websites such as Opensea.io where you can buy and sell NFT items. These marketplaces are
					similar to eBay. You can easily buy and sell NFTs here for a fixed price or in an auction.
