				<h1>Welcome to the Phanaverse!</h1>
				<p>
					By phans, for phans, PhanFT is a series of blockchain-powered NFT projects to celebrate
					and further solidify this amazing music and art-loving community under shared purpose and
					common passions.
				</p>
				<p>
					Together, we&apos;re lighting the torch for a whole new paradigm for Phans to connect,
					spread joy, and share in the groove with the greatest band and community in the world.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>The Lizards</h2>
				<p>
					Our genesis project is The Lizards - a limited collection of 2001 NFTs, where ownership
					doubles as your membership to the ultimate Phan club loaded with benefits, utility, and
					perks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each Lizard is unique and programmatically generated from over 100 possible art-traits,
					including expression, clothing, accessories, and other attributes that give a wink and a
					nod to the song&apos;s folklore.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some Lizards are illustrated as part of artist collaborations and even more rare. This
					first collection will also include 25 extra-special NFTs minted at random of an aging
					knight in gnarly armor, who was once a lizard too.

				<h2>Phase 1.0 Roadmap&nbsp;</h2>
				<p>We&rsquo;re in it for the long haul-our intent is all for your delight.</p>
				<p>
					We&rsquo;ve set some milestones to keep us accountable and on-track to delivering this
					project&rsquo;s vision. As each percentage of Lizards sales is met below, we will start
					work on realizing that stated goal.
				</p>
				<p>25%</p>
				<p>The first 555 owners to purchase Lizards will receive a special physical merch item.</p>
				<p>40%</p>
				<p>
					We free 5 enslaved lizards (NFTs held back from the original sale) to be airdropped at
					random to existing Lizard holders.

				<p>50%</p>
				<p>Halfway to the moon ðŸš€ðŸŒ”</p>
