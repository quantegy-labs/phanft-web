          By phans, for phans, PhanFT is a series of blockchain-powered NFT
          projects to celebrate and further solidify this amazing music and
          art-loving community under shared purpose and common passions.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Together, we&apos;re lighting the torch for a whole new paradigm for
          Phans to connect, spread joy, and share in the groove with the
          greatest band and community in the world.

        <Typography variant="h3">The Lizards</Typography>
        <Typography>
          Our genesis project is The Lizards - a limited collection of 2001
          NFTs, where ownership doubles as your membership to the ultimate Phan
          club loaded with benefits, utility, and perks.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Each Lizard is unique and programmatically generated from over 100
          possible art-traits, including expression, clothing, accessories, and
          other attributes that give a wink and a nod to the song&apos;s
          folklore.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Some Lizards are illustrated as part of artist collaborations and even
          more rare. This first collection will also include 25 extra-special
          NFTs minted at random of an aging knight in gnarly armor, who was once
          a lizard too.
